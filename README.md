# university project for predicting the box office of movies and dividing movies into various groups
This study concerns international films released in theaters from 1980 to 2020. A
dataset on films, found on kaggle, was used, and the information on the films comes from various sites including IMDb.
Since the dataset contained representative anomalies, it was necessary to process the
dataset so that it was more consistent with our objectives:
• Creation of the knowledge base, in order to obtain new knowledge useful for the
subsequent steps
• Forecasting the earnings of the films, based on the features, establishing those that
have the greatest influence (supervised learning)
• Subdivision of the dataset based on common characteristics (unsupervised
learning)
• Creation of a Bayesian network, able to calculate the probability that a film belongs to
one of the following classes: big flop, flop, success, masterpiece.
